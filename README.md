# Media List App

Created using React Native and Firebase for authentication and storage.

This app is to help a user remember different TV shows, movies and games they may want to watch/play in one convenient app on their phone.
This is to eliminate the need for storing them on different lists across different streaming services and platforms.

It also allows a user to randomly pick an item from their lists if they can't decide what to watch or play and want help choosing.
